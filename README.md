# Happy-Lines

Happy Lines is a basic but fast recursive LOC calculator written in C (might change to C++ in future).

To use it, enter the below written command:

```bash
make run
```

## Avaliable features:
* Basic TUI for limited interaction
* Ignore/exclude specific folders

## Planned features:
* More advanced TUI
* Language specific LOC calculator
* Multi-threaded support for optimization
* Better Command line arguments
